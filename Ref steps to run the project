Import the project. Following files will be available Feature file, Step definition file, Runner file, Wrapper File.

Both the scenarios are implemented in the Feature file with different tag names.

To run both the scenarios include the both the tag names in the runner class under tag section

If we want to run only one scenario goto the Feature file and get the respective annotations and keep that anotations in the runner file.

Example to run one testcase :: tags= {"@updatescenario"},

Run the runner file using Junit.
